## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

### 1. Revenue Growth
Revenue grew from R$127K in January 2017 to R$1.15M in November 2017 — a **9x increase in 10 months**. The November peak confirms Black Friday as the strongest sales event on the platform.

### 2. Delivery Drives Satisfaction
The most powerful finding in the dataset — delivery time is the **single biggest driver of customer satisfaction:**

| Delivery Time | Avg Review Score |
|---|---|
| 0–5 days | 4.43 |
| 6–10 days | 4.35 |
| 11–15 days | 4.25 |
| 16–20 days | 4.09 |
| 21–30 days | 3.58 |
| 30+ days | 2.17 |

### 3. Customer Retention Crisis
**97% of customers never returned** after their first purchase. Only 3% are repeat buyers. RFM analysis reveals 37,340 customers in the "At Risk" segment generating R$6.17M — the biggest retention opportunity for the business.

### 4. Geographic Divide
São Paulo dominates with R$5.77M revenue and only 8.3 days average delivery. Northern states like Alagoas (24 days avg, 21.4% late rate) and Amazonas (26 days avg) face severe logistics challenges reflected in lower review scores.
